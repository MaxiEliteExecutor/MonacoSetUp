#How to Set Up WebView2 in C# WinForms Application (for .NET 8.0)

This tutorial will guide you through setting up WebView2, a modern web view control for embedding web content into your WinForms application, with proper handling for initialization events and error handling. The example demonstrates how to use `CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted` for WebView2 initialization.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:
1. Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. .NET 8.0 installed.
3. WebView2 Runtime installed on your machine. You can get it here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Install the WebView2 NuGet Package
1. Open your C# project in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. In the Browse tab, search for `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` and click Install.

Step 2: Initialize WebView2 in Your Form
1. In your Form.cs file, import the necessary namespaces:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Web.WebView2.WinForms;
    using Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core;
    using System;
    using System.Windows.Forms;
    ```

2. Add a WebView2 control to your form. This can be done via the Toolbox or dynamically in your code:

    ```csharp
    private WebView2 webView2;
    ```

3. In the form's constructor, initialize WebView2 and add it to the form:

    ```csharp
    public MainForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        
        // Create and add WebView2 control
        webView2 = new WebView2();
        this.Controls.Add(webView2);
        webView2.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
        
        // Initialize WebView2 asynchronously
        InitializeWebView2Async();
    }
    ```

Step 3: Handle WebView2 Initialization
1. Use the `EnsureCoreWebView2Async()` method to initialize WebView2 asynchronously.
2. After initialization, subscribe to the `CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted` event:

    ```csharp
    private async void InitializeWebView2Async()
    {
        // Initialize WebView2 asynchronously
        await webView2.EnsureCoreWebView2Async();
        
        // Hook into the initialization completed event
        webView2.CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted += CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted;
    }
    ```

3. Define the event handler for `CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted` to perform actions once the WebView2 is ready:

    ```csharp
    private void CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("WebView2 initialization completed!");
        
        // After initialization is complete, you can navigate to a URL
        webView2.CoreWebView2.Navigate("https://www.example.com");
    }
    ```

Step 4: Run the Application
1. Compile and run your application.
2. You should see the WebView2 control load within your form and navigate to the specified URL once initialization is completed.

Common Issues and Troubleshooting
1. WebView2 Not Loading Properly:
    - Ensure the WebView2 Runtime is installed. You can download it from here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/.
    
2. Initialization Errors:
    - Make sure you're calling `EnsureCoreWebView2Async()` correctly before accessing any WebView2-related features.
    - Subscribe to the `CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted` event to ensure the WebView2 has finished initializing before using it.

Conclusion
Now you've successfully set up WebView2 in your WinForms application, with proper handling for initialization and navigation. You can now embed modern web content directly inside your application using WebView2, giving your users a seamless experience.
